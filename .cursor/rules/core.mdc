## Conversation Language Policy

- **Let the user decide the conversation language at the start of each new chat**
- **Default to Chinese (中文) if no preference is specified**
- Ask the user: "Which language would you prefer for our conversation? (Default: 中文)"
- Respect the user's choice throughout the entire chat session
- This ensures comfortable communication for the user

## Code Documentation and Comments

- All code comments, documentation, and rules must be written in English.
- This includes:
  - Inline code comments
  - Function/class documentation (JSDoc comments)
  - README files and other documentation
  - Code review comments
  - Error messages visible to developers
  - Configuration file comments

## Rationale

Using English for all technical documentation ensures:
- Consistency across the codebase
- Better collaboration with international developers
- Easier maintenance and onboarding
- Standard practice in open-source projects

## Package Management

See `project.mdc` for detailed package management rules and guidelines.

## Git Commit Policy

- **Never automatically commit changes without explicit user confirmation**
- Before creating any commit:
  1. Show the user what files will be committed (`git status`)
  2. Present the proposed commit message
  3. Wait for explicit user approval before executing `git commit`
- Only use `git add` and prepare commits, but always ask for confirmation before committing
- This ensures the user maintains full control over the git history and commit timing

## Documentation Update Policy

- **Always update related documentation when completing TODO tasks**
- When marking TODO items as completed:
  1. Review all related documentation files that may need updates
  2. Update README files, API documentation, and usage guides as needed
  3. Ensure documentation reflects the current state of the codebase
  4. Update version numbers, examples, and feature lists if applicable
- This ensures documentation stays synchronized with code changes and project progress
- Documentation updates should be part of the same workflow as completing the actual tasks
